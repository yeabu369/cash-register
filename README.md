# Cash Register Application

This application is a simple cash register simulator built using React. It allows you to add and remove money in different denominations, and dispense change.
## Functionality

The main functionality of the application is contained within the CashRegister component.

The CashRegister component maintains a state of the cash register, which is an object where the keys are the denominations of the money and the values are the counts of each denomination.

```javascript
const [register, setRegister] = useState({
  20: 0,
  10: 0,
  5: 0,
  2: 0,
  1: 0
});
```

The application provides the following functionalities:

1. **Add Money**: You can add money to the cash register by entering the count of each denomination and clicking the "Add" button. The addMoney function is used to update the state of the cash register.

2. **Remove Money**: You can remove money from the cash register by entering the count of each denomination and clicking the "Remove" button. The removeMoney function is used to update the state of the cash register.

3. **Dispense Change**: You can dispense change by entering an amount and clicking the "Dispense" button. The dispenseChange function is used to update the state of the cash register.

The current state of the cash register is displayed on the screen, showing the total amount of money and the count of each denomination.
## Testing
